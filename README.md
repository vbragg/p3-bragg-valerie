Project 3 for AW2

No outside sources were used.

I had a few issues with the project. It took me a while to figure out how to organize the boxes to get them to move over and then out and over.

I also couldn't remember how to use a class in javascript, since it's not interchangable with getElementById. I then found a past assignment and tried a for loop and that worked.
